**Current version**: version 0.0.1 (_Layer of Fog_)

Voxelwind is an upcoming _Minecraft: Pocket Edition_ server project written in Java. It aims to provide a Java-first API,
provide high performance, high scalability and flexibility while being easy to use for causal users.

Voxelwind aims to be a comprehensive implementation of MCPE, **but is currently incomplete and lacks several important features**.

Voxelwind is licensed under the permissive **MIT** license. However, we would love if you submit improvements you make to
Voxelwind upstream so that the larger community can benefit from them.

## Special Thanks

* [MiNET](https://github.com/NiclasOlofsson/MiNET) was invaluable in helping me figure out some of the more difficult stuff.
* [yawkat's protocol documentation](https://confluence.yawk.at/display/PEPROTOCOL/pe-protocol-docs+Home) was also useful, especially for encryption.
* [BungeeCord](https://github.com/SpigotMC/BungeeCord)'s native compression and cryptography support is used in Voxelwind for more performance. We [forked it](https://github.com/minecrafter/voxelwind-natives) for our use.
* [minecraft-data](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/minecraft-data) was used to generate item and block type data.
* [The Hive](https://hivemc.com) is sponsoring the project.

## Requirements

To run Voxelwind, Java 8 (optionally with [unlimited strength cryptography policy files](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce8-download-2133166.html)
for Xbox authentication support) is required. Additionally, it is strongly recommended you run Voxelwind on a recent 64-bit x86 Debian-based Linux distribution
(Debian 8 or Ubuntu 16.04) for two reasons:

* Voxelwind can use multiple threads to listen to the same port on Linux (`SO_REUSEPORT`). **JDK 9 includes native support
for this flag, so it is likely this will appear in a future Netty version.**
* Voxelwind can take advantage of native compression and encryption support.

Voxelwind will work on other configurations outside 64-bit Debian/Ubuntu, but scalability and throughput will be affected.
